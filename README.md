# Cool [WIP](https://www.wking.io/): The one year later "Coming Soon" Personal Website
This is the Work In Progress that is my personal website. I have said on my old site that I had an update "Coming Soon" for about a year now and I am done with that. 

About a week ago I actually started updating my site after stumbling on Gatsby while listening to [@wesbos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) and [@stolinsky](https://twitter.com/stolinski)'s podcast [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/). A week later I realized I can get this up and running really quick, but will need help refining and optimizing my code.

## A Call For Help
I am fairly new to React and would love feedback from any experienced Front End Devs who are willing to help out!

If you are experienced with Front End Dev then I imagine you already know how to get this working without help, but just in case...

### Clone / Fork Repo
You can follow Github's guide here: [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

### Install Dependencies
`npm i`

### Running in development
`gatsby develop`

## Wanna help? 
I have tasks I am adding to the issues to help me keep track of the project. I have gotten it to a state now to where I want to use branches and proper PRs to manage updates. Take a look around in there or make your own if you think my code could use some help :)

## [WIP] Changelog

**08 / 09 / 2017**
Update, I have figured out a few things I want to do. I am loving importing data from any JS file. I have used it to add social accounts and a knowledgebase. Wanted to simulate pulling in real data so that I could get more familar with manipulating it.

I have been able to pull in the added objects / rows in the knowledgebase data file and convert them to a book -> chapter format. Using react-lowlight I added syntax highlighting to the library page and look forward to improving the code examples.

**08 / 01 / 2017**
This is where it all begins. I will outline what I am using below that I think might be relevant.

- I think I want to copy the layout of the home page to all pages as a uniform header and want to make a more reusable component for that.
- Styled Components
- Prettier
